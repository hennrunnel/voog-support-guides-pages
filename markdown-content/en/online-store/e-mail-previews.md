## Invoice

This PDF invoice will be sent to the customer if they choose the **Offline invoice**as the payment method. The invoice is attached to the e-mail.   
  
On this invoice, the customer can see their own information, the order number, order details and the web-store's information.

## Invoice notification

The invoice notification is the e-mail that will be sent to the customer when they buy something from the web store and choose an **Offline invoice** as the payment choice. This is the e-mail that has the aforementioned invoice attached to it.  
  
From this notification, the customer can see an information e-mail to which they can send questions about the invoice. They can also find details of the order, payment information and shipment information.

## Payment notification

The payment notification is sent to the customer once they have made a successful payment via a payment gateway. After that, the gateway sends a notification to the system about the status of the payment and automatically marks it as paid.  
  
In addition to the order details and the information e-mail, the customer can also see their own information.

## PDF invoice payment notification

This notification is sent out when the store owner makes the order payment status to **Paid** under **Store > Orders**.  
  
In addition to the order details, the PDF invoice payment notification shows the customer their own information as well.

## **Modifying Emails**

Previews of the emails sent to customers who have placed an order through the online store can be found in the **Store > Settings > Emails** view.
