All Voog subscriptions (including the 30-day Trial) support e-commerce on your site, so - building an online store has never been easier.  
  
 To get started, add your store's general information and products, set up shipping and payment methods, and customize checkout fields if necessary.   
  
 Follow the steps below to configure the necessary settings and launch your store. You’ll find all the required information by clicking **Store > Settings** on the toolbar at the bottom of the screen.  

![Store settings menu.](https://media.voog.com/0000/0036/2183/photos/store_settings_view_block.webp "Store settings menu.")

## Setting up general store information

You’ll find your store’s general information under **Store > Settings > Store information**. Make sure to complete all fields marked with an asterisk (*) for your store to be visible to website visitors.  
  
 From the **Store information** view, you can:  

- enter or edit your store details and address
- configure invoice details
- add, edit, or remove VAT rates
- manage your store visibility by choosing whether it’s fully active with sales enabled, visible only for showcasing products, or the store is completely inaccessible to the public.

## Adding shipping methods

To add shipping methods, go to **Store > Settings > Shipping methods**.  
 Here you can add suitable options — either automatically updated pick-up points lists (Omniva, DPD, SmartPosti) or custom shipping methods (e.g., courier, pick up your parcel yourself).  
 You can find more details in the [shipping guide](https://www.voog.com/support/online-store/add-shipping-methods).  
  
 **Shipping labels and automatic data exchange**  
 You can enable automatic data exchange for downloading shipping labels directly from your Voog order view. This applies to [Omniva](https://www.voog.com/support/online-store/automatic-data-exchange-with-omniva), [DPD](https://www.voog.com/support/online-store/automatic-data-exchange-with-dpd), and [SmartPosti](https://www.voog.com/support/online-store/automatic-data-exchange-with-itella) services.  

## Setting up payment methods

By default, invoice payment is enabled. You can also add the following payment methods:  

- Voog Pay
- Swedbank e-commerce payments
- Maksekeskus payment options
- Montonio
- PayPal
- EveryPay

  
 These can be configured under **Store > Settings > Payments**.  
 Learn more in the [payment methods guide.](https://www.voog.com/support/online-store/payment-methods)  

## Adding products

When you add a new product to your store, a product page is automatically generated in all site languages.   
  
You can access (and view) these automatically generated product pages in two ways:  
  

- **through** [**product list**](https://www.voog.com/support/online-store/how-to-add-buy-buttons-and-new-products-to-your-online-store) view.
- **Via a direct link**, which you can find in the **Edit product** view, under the **Locations** section. There, the address of the product page is displayed — by clicking the arrow icon next to it, the product page will open in a new view.

![URL of product's location on the website.](https://media.voog.com/0000/0036/2183/photos/edit_product_addres_block.webp "URL of product's location on the website.")

**You can add products in three ways:**  

- **Product management view** — add and manage products via the **Products** view. Learn more about using the [product management view](https://www.voog.com/support/online-store/how-to-add-buy-buttons-and-new-products-to-your-online-store#add-a-product-through-the-product-management-view).

- **Products content area** — add products directly in the page content where they will be displayed. Learn how to add products using the [**Products**](https://www.voog.com/support/online-store/how-to-add-buy-buttons-and-new-products-to-your-online-store#add-a-product-through-the-products-content-area) [content area](https://www.voog.com/support/online-store/how-to-add-buy-buttons-and-new-products-to-your-online-store#add-a-product-through-the-products-content-area).

- **Importing products from a file** — if you're dealing with a larger quantity of products, importing them from a file is a convenient and efficient way to add them all at once. This method allows you to save time by uploading multiple products in bulk, rather than adding each one manually. Learn more in the product [import guide.](https://www.voog.com/support/online-store/products-import)

  
 **Important information when adding products:**  

- **Product variants** — variations allow you to add different options to the same product, such as sizes, colors, etc. Read [how to add product variants](https://www.voog.com/support/online-store/how-to-add-product-variantshttps://www.voog.com/support/online-store/how-to-add-product-variants).
- **Stock value** — helps track inventory and prevent stockouts. More info in the [stock management guide](https://www.voog.com/support/online-store/inventory-management-in-your-webstore).
- **Product categories** — products can be placed in different categories (e.g. clothes, shoes, handbags, etc.) to make the store clearer and easier to navigate for customers. Learn to assign [product categories.](https://www.voog.com/support/online-store/how-to-add-buy-buttons-and-new-products-to-your-online-store#categories)

## Customer notifications

As the store owner, you will receive a notification of every new order. Your store system sends automated email notifications to the customer in the following cases:  

- **When the customer selects** [**invoice payment**](https://www.voog.com/support/online-store/pay-by-invoice)  — an order confirmation with a PDF invoice is sent to the customer.
- **When the order has been successfully paid** (including via bank link or other online payment methods) — a payment confirmation is sent to the customer.

  
 Read more about [email notifications](https://www.voog.com/support/online-store/e-mail-previews).  

## Customizing checkout fields

Go to **Store > Settings > Checkout** to add, remove, or modify checkout form fields.  
[Learn more about customizing checkout fields.](https://www.voog.com/support/online-store/checkout-fields)  

## Terms and refund policy

To ensure a trustworthy and transparent shopping experience, your cart should include a link to your store’s terms and refund policy page. This allows customers to review important information before completing their purchase.  
  
 If you don’t have your own terms yet, you can use Voog sample templates as a starting point. You’ll find them in your store under **Store > Settings > Store information**, next to the **Communication** section.  
  
 To set this up:  

- Create a new hidden page on your site
- Paste and customize the sample terms
- Hide the page from the menu
- Copy the page URL and add it to **Store > Settings > Store information** next to the **Communication** section

  
 See the guide [how to create a terms of service page link.](https://www.voog.com/support/video-tutorials/creating-terms-of-service-page-link)  

## Test order and order management

Before going live, make a test order to ensure everything (emails, payments, notifications) works properly.  
  
 After a test order, we recommend:  

1. **Mark the order as canceled** — this is useful when you want to cancel the order yourself for any reason. Cancelling an order will release the product reservation, making the item available for purchase again.
2. **Archive the order** — helps keep your order list clean and organized.

  
 See [the guide on managing orders.](https://www.voog.com/support/online-store/manage-your-orders)  
  
 Please note that all transactions with the payment status **Paid** are included in the e-commerce transaction fee calculation. If you cancel an order, no transaction fee will be charged for that transaction. Read more about [how e-commerce transaction fee is calculated.](https://www.voog.com/support/your-subscriptions/store-transaction-fees)  

## 

## Reports

Sales reports are valuable for every shop owner. Upon opening the **Reports** tab, you can view sales by month and year as well as Voog’s transaction fees. You can view the sales during that period and the income from each separate order by clicking on a month. These orders may be filtered by date, sum and transaction fees by clicking on **Filter**. Clicking an order opens the order’s details.

  

[The transaction fee (3% of sales)](/support/your-subscriptions/store-transaction-fees) applies to stores on the [Standard or Plus plans](/pricing) — the Premium plan is exempt from transaction fees. **Also, if you use [Voog Pay](/support/online-store/voog-pay) for your payments, you won't have to pay this fee.**

We send an invoice for transaction fees once above the 30 € threshold. Value-added tax is added to the transaction fees. The invoice is sent out once per month.  
  
Reports are updated daily and they are based on orders marked as **Paid**.

## Domains

[Add a custom domain to your site](https://www.voog.com/support/your-website-addresses/using-your-already-existing-domain) and [set a default domain form](https://www.voog.com/support/your-website-addresses/domain-settings#default-domain-form) for SEO.  

## SEO and search engine visibility

Once your site and store are ready, inform search engines to help people find you.
