When a customer makes a purchase in your store, they have to enter their details at the checkout. Sometimes you need some extra information about their purchase. For example, the customer might wish to leave a short note with their order. Or if the order is to be delivered to a pick-up point, the customer's phone number is always required. To ensure all necessary information is included, you can customize your store's checkout.  

## How to access checkout settings?

To view checkout settings, go to **Store > Settings > Checkout**.  
  
Here, current fields are displayed in the order they appear at checkout. You may add, customize or delete/hide fields in this view and preview your checkout form by clicking **Preview** at the top. To reset the fields to their default state, click **Reset**.

## How to add a new field?

Click on **Add new field** link on the top right. Fill out the fields in the dialog that appears and click on **Apply** button at the bottom of the page or press **Ctrl/âŒ˜+S**.

## How to customize a field?

Customize a field by clicking on it, which opens up a settings dialog. Under **Type** you can select the field type. **Layout** determines how fields are laid out. If you select 'Single field', the field will always be placed onto a separate line. Selecting 'Side by side' allows two fields to be placed on the same line, depending on the customer's screen width. To view your current layout, take a look at the preview option described above.

## How to delete a field?

Only fields that you have created can be deleted. System fields can only be disabled (thus hidden), but not deleted. There are two options to delete or hide a field:  

1. Click on the three dots next to the field and select **Disable** or **Delete**.
2. Click on the field; in the options dialog, click on the **eye** or **trashcan** icon.

## How to change the order of the fields?

To reorder your fields, click on one of your fields and drag it to your preferred location.

## How to require filling in a field?

Again, there are two options to do so:  

1. Click on the three dots next to the field and select **Set as required**.
2. Click on the field and select the **Required field** option from the options dialog.

## How to translate fields?

Translate the field's title and helper text by clicking on the field and selecting a language from the top-right corner. Only translatable properties remain editable.
