If you have successfully [set up your online store](/support/online-store/add-online-store), you can start selling your goods immediately with [offline invoice](/support/online-store/offline-payments).   
  
Additionally, I would like to draw your attention to the fact that before adding payment provider, you should associate your website [with a personal domain](/support/your-website-addresses) and [create a privacy policy and terms of use subpage(s)](/support/video-tutorials/creating-terms-of-service-page-link).

## Payment methods view and adding a new payment provider

To add another payment provider, open **Store > Settings > Payments**. You can see that you already have one payment method – **[Offline](/support/online-store/offline-payments)** – which, as the name suggests, is for offline payments and doesn't require further setup.

Click on **Add payment provider** to see a list of paymentproviders that you can set up on your store.

## Payment provider and their activation guides

A selection of various payment providers that have integration with Voog. By clicking on a payment provider, you will find a detailed guide on how to add the given payment provider to your online store.
