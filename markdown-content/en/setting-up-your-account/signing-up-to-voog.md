Signing up to Voog is simple, free and takes almost no time at all. The fastest way to sign up is by simply clicking on the**Create website for free** button at [voog.com](https://voog.com/).

You're directed to our choose-a-design page, where you can choose an initial template to get started with your site.  
  
 When you've chosen a suitable template, you'll have to provide a minimal amount of information so we can get you started right away.

**First,** choose a title for your website.

The title will be generated into a technical address for your Voog site and it will always remain connected to it. You can easily add a [custom domain name](/support/your-website-addresses/which-addresses-can-you-use-with-voog) afterwards and keep the technical address as a private, backup URL to your Voog site.  
  
 **Second,** we need your e-mail address.  
  
 Make sure that you enter a valid e-mail address. This will be used as the primary contact regarding all notifications, monthly reports and important updates about your website. If you ever need to change it, you'll just have to invite a new user to the site with your new e-mail address. This e-mail address will also be used to verify your site.  
  
**And third,** come up with a good password that will always keep your account safe.  
  
You can also sign up using your Google account. Just enter your website title and click the Google button below. This links your Voog account with your Google account, so you can log in the same way next time.  
  
 After you've completed the sign-up process, you will automatically activate **a free 30-day Voog trial subscription**.

This means that you will be able to use Voog on a fully upgraded level. Feel free to use these 30 days to get accustomed to our tool and build up your website without worrying about immediately ordering a paid subscription.
