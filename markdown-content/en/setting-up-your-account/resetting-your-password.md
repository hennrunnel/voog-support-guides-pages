## Changing your password

There are two ways to change your password in Voog.   
  
One option is to log in to your site and click **Dashboard**, which is located at the bottom left of the toolbar. From there, click the round icon next to your name in the top right corner of the site. Then select **My profile** and click **Change** next to the **Password** field at the bottom of the menu.

## Resetting your password

If you can't sign in with the password that you've previously chosen, please re-check if you're really typing it correctly. In case you copy-pasted it, make sure any extra spaces or characters aren't included by accident. If that still doesn't work, click the **Forgot?** link of the [sign-in view](https://www.voog.com/login?language_code=en). That is visible only after entering your e-mail address.

You'll be directed to a form where you can enter the email address you registered with Voog. Click the **Reset password** button, and a password reset link with instructions will be sent to your email.

## If solutions from above aren't working

If you've tried all of the solutions above and you're still not having any luck with logging in, get in touch with us at [support@voog.com](mailto: support@voog.com). Don't forget to add the name of your website and the e-mail address that you've signed up to with (in case you're e-mailing us from another address).  
  
Note that all sites tied to one email share the same password. Access all your sites by clicking **Dashboard** in the bottom left corner.
