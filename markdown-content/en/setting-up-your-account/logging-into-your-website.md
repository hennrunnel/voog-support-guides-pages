## The direct login method

Among the website login options, the most direct method is to visit [voog.com](https://www.voog.com/) and click the **Log in** link located in the upper right corner of the page.

Enter the email and password you used during registration, or sign in with your Google account.

## The alternative method

A different way to access the login window is by appending **/admin** to your website's URL (such as **example.com/admin** or **example.voog.com/admin**).

## Accessing multiple websites

If you're associated with multiple Voog sites under the same email address, you can use the **Dashboard** link to switch between them. In the **Sites** view that opens, you'll see all Voog websites.
