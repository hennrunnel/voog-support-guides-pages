## Changing swiftly between your Voog sites

Suppose you have registered several websites with one e-mail address. In that case, you can quickly switch between them by opening the **Dashboard** at the bottom left corner.

If you wish to edit a website that you manage with another e-mail account, you need to log out of the site. For that, click on the rounded icon after your name in the **Dashboard**. Then proceed to the log-in window [https://www.voog.com/login](/login).

## Creating a new Voog site quickly

To register a new site with an existing Voog account, go to **Dashboard**. In the top right corner of the opened view, you'll find the **Add new site** button, which you can click to create a new page.

Next, you'll be redirected to our design gallery, where you can choose a suitable design for your developing site. You'll also need to enter a valid password and select a technical address for your site, which will remain the identifying address for your site within our system. Later, you can add alternative, free **.voog.com** ending domain names or completely personalized domain names (e.g., mycompany.com) to it.
