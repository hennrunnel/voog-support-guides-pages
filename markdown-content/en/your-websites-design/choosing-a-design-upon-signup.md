After clicking the **Create website for free** button, you are taken to a new view ([voog.com/signup](/signup)), where you can see all our template designs. The designs are divided under categories **Website**, **Online store**, and **Blog** to make it easier to get started. Despite the categories â€“ all the templates support the same functionality. For example, if you choose the **Online store** template, you can also set up blogs and common pages for your site.

After you've found the design you like the most, you can pick that design for your website by clicking on the **Choose** button.   
  
And just like that, you've got yourself a superb design to get you going. Go on and [get started](https://voog.com/#signup).
