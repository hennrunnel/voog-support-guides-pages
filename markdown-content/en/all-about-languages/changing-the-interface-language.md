To change the interface language, open Dashboard, click the icon next to your name and My Profile. Select a language from the Language dropdown.
You can also change the language by logging out of your Voog account first and then proceeding to the login page.
Our available interface languages are listed on the upper-right side of the login page. Select your preferred language and log back into your Voog site, and it will be saved automatically as your default language.
