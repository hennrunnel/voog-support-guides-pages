Whenever you create a site on Voog with more than one language, it will automatically detect your visitor's language based on their browser settings or location.

To set a default language, you'll need to go to **Content > Structure** and select the preferred language that you'd like to set as default from the header menu.

The **Which language visitors see?** selection allows you to select the current language as a default for all guests. After you've done that, click on the **Save** button in the Voog user interface and the default language will be set.
