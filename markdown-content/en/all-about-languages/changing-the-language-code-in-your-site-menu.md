## How do I change the title or language code of an existing language?

First, go to **Content > Structure** and select the preferred language that you'd like to manage from the header menu.

![Cursor on the language option in the structure view.](https://media.voog.com/0000/0036/2183/photos/Languages3-1_block.png "Cursor on the language option in the structure view.")

Clicking the **Language name** field opens a drop-down menu, where you can pick the language you want to duplicate and translate your web page to. This is important, as this setting will affect [which flag will be displayed](/support/all-about-languages/configuring-the-flags-menu) on the language menu for your visitors.

From the **Name in menu** field, you'll be able to change the title that this language is displayed within the language menu.

**Is this language publicly visible?** gives you an option to opt out of any languages you don't want to display. This is a useful tool if you are still expanding your site into different languages and don't want your customers to go to half-done pages.

**NB!** If you opt out of **all the languages in your language menu**, your webpage will not be accessible for visitors (as browsers are restricted to use any of the languages possible â€” the page will not be displayed). This will return a "Page not found" error.

**Which language do my visitors see?** The menu allows you to select the current language as a default for all the guests or lets the preference be detected by location. You can read more about it [here](/support/all-about-languages/choosing-the-default-language-for-your-visitors).

Last, give the website a new name from the **Website title** field and once you've finished with the changes, click the**Save**button from the Voog user interface and your changes will be applied.
