## How can I create a menu button if I wish to direct clients to a specific web address?

If you add a new page in your **Content > Structure** menu, you can add a link instead.

Give the link a page title and insert the address you'd like your visitors to be directed to and then click on **Add it**.

## How can I modify or delete the link?

Click on the cogwheel on your previously added linked page in your **Content > Structure** menu to change it. Click on the trash bin icon to delete the linked page.
