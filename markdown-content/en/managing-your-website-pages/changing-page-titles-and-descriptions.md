## Understanding the Importance of Website Content

Effective website content is crucial for engaging your audience and conveying your message. Refer to the [Edit titles and descriptions](/support/seo/titles-and-descriptions) chapter in the [SEO](/support/seo) menu to see detailed explanations for these topics.

## Editing titles

### Website title

If you'd like to add or change the title of your website, enter the **Content** menu and click on **Structure**.

You'll be directed to a page where you can see your current **Website title** listed. Click on it and replace it with a new title. Remember to save your changes with the **Save** button from the lower-right side of the Voog panel.

### Page title

Click on the page settings icon at the lower right side of your Voog menu (right next to the **Preview** button), and **Page settings** will open on the right. From there, you'll be able to see your current page title, URL, layout, keywords, description, visibility and the option to either show changes performed on this page automatically or not.

Click on the **Title** field and write your preferred title in there. Then press on **Save** and the title will be set.

By regularly editing your website content, you can provide your visitors with up-to-date information and an engaging user experience.

## Optimizing Website Metadata

Metadata plays a crucial role in improving your website's visibility and search engine rankings.

Within the **Page settings** panel, navigate to the **SEO** tab. You'll see the page title, meta description, search engine preview and a toggle switch for setting the page visible to search engines.

Click on the meta description area and write down a short (up to 150 characters) but informative description for your website. When you're ready, save your changes by clicking on the **Save** button.
