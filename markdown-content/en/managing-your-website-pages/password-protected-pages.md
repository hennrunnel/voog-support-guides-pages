Sometimes it's necessary to share a page with a select few - that's where our password protection feature comes in handy. And to really ensure your privacy, our password-protected pages won't show up in search engines since they've been disabled in the robots.txt file.

Once you've chosen to add password protection to a page on your website, note that users invited to view password-protected pages have global access. This means the users you invite can see all password-protected pages on your site, not just a specific page.

Go to the page that you need to add the password to, and open page settings from the bottom right corner of your Voog panel. Select **Password protected** from the **Access** menu and your page is protected.
