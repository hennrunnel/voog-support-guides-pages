After [creating a new page](/support/managing-your-website-pages/creating-new-or-removing-old-pages "Link: /support/managing-your-website-pages/creating-new-or-removing-old-pages") and naming it, our system automatically offers a respective web address for it. Nevertheless, it's always possible to change it.

## Changing the URL of a page

Enter the page of the URL of which you'd like to change, from the bottom right corner, and replace the current page address from the upcoming menu.

**NB! Always save changes after you've finished with your configurations.**  
  

As an alternative, you can also change your page addresses in the structure view. Simply open **Content > Structure** and proceed to the correct language from the upcoming page.

Click on the gear icon behind the desired page name and simply change its address.  
  
By the way, it's not possible to change the address of the front page from this menu. Your front page doesn't have a separate page address. The front page's address is the webpage URL. Feel free to look at options to [add more free Voog addresses to your site](/support/your-website-addresses/adding-more-free-addresses "Link: /support/your-website-addresses/adding-more-free-addresses") if you're looking to change the site address.
