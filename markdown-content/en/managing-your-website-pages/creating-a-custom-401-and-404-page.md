## What exactly are 401 and 404 pages?

The **401 Unauthorized Error** is displayed when the visitor attempts to access a password-protected page without providing the necessary credentials (valid email address and password). Alternatively, it may indicate that access to the page is restricted and the visitor does not have the necessary permissions.

On the other hand, the **404 Not Found** error signifies that the visitor is trying to access a page that does not exist on an otherwise active and working website.
