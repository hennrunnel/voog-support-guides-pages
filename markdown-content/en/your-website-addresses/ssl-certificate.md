## Acquiring an SSL certificate

You can add a free Let's Encrypt certificate from the **Settings > Domains > SSL certificates** view. All you have to do is tick the domain or domains to which you'd like to add a certificate.

You can get an option to add your own certificate by another service provider by subscribing to our Premium plan.

## Forcing SSL

For using only encrypted traffic on your website, you can choose to**Force SSL**. Go to your domains menu and click on the toggle button of **Force SSL** to activate it.  
  
Make sure the SSL certificate is activated before you force SSL.

You can check that by typing your website's address on the URL bar with the **https://** prefix and when it displays your site, you're good to go. Otherwise, you lose access to your website.
