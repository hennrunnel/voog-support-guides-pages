## How do I buy a domain from Voog?

With Voog, you can buy as many domains for your website as you wish and they all work as aliases (pointing to your website).   
  
To buy a domain, log in to your website, go to **Settings** **>** **Domains**, click the **Add new** button, and select **Buy new.**

![Clicking on 'Add new' and then 'Buy new' in the domains menu.](https://media.voog.com/0000/0036/2183/photos/domain_buy_new_block.webp "Clicking on 'Add new' and then 'Buy new' in the domains menu.")

Now type the domain address you wish to buy (without the **www** prefix) into the field given below. Click on the **Search** and choose the one (or hey, take several ones already) you like by adding them to your cart (**Add to cart** button behind the domain name).  
Continue by clicking on **Check out** in the top bar and you are directed to the store view (if you have a subscription). You can now modify the items from behind the domain name (e.g. change the period you wish for your subscription).  
  
After setting up the items, fill in the necessary fields and make the payment with a preferred payment method. When the payment is done and registration has been completed, your domain will begin to work in the next few hours.  
  
**Please note that y****ou can buy a personal domain for your site only if you have a Voog subscription.**
