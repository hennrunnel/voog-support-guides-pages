To create a Mailchimp pop-up signup form and embed it, follow [these instruction given by Mailchimp](https://mailchimp.com/help/add-a-signup-form-to-your-website/). After setting up the form you're given an embed code that you can paste to your Voog website.

If you want the pop-up form to be displayed on only one page, you’ll have to paste the second part of the code into a **Text** content area. Click on the video or code button on the text toolbar, paste the code, and select **Insert**.

If you want the popup to be displayed on all of your pages then it is easier to go to Voog menu **Settings > Site** and paste the second part of your code into the **External tracking code** field. Don’t forget to **Save** and you are all good!
