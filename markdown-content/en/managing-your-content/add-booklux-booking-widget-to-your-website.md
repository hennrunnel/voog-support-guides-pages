## Setting up BookLux

To begin, go to the [BookLux website](https://www.booklux.com/) and click on the **Try Free** button.

This leads you to create an account and choose a category for your booking calendar – in the example below, we’ve chosen a sports club. At BookLux you can easily create a service calendar, assign a room and a location to each service and create [several other options](https://www.booklux.com/en#overview). This way, a customer can book a service at any time and location they prefer.  
  
At the left of your admin view, you can see several settings. For example, **Calendar** shows bookings made by customers. By clicking on a booking, you can see further details of the booking and the customer and you have the option to confirm it.  
  
**Training spots** and **Schedule** let you add rooms (for example, training rooms if you run a gym) and set a different schedule for each room, respectively. When you go to **Services**, you can add and manage your services, assign each one a price and duration and select a room or rooms for the service.

## Adding the booking widget to your Voog website

To add the form to your website, open **Client view options** from the menu bar. You can embed the booking form in two ways – either as a form displayed right on the page or as a button that opens the form as a popup. To place the form right on the page, copy the code from the **Booking view** box. To create a button, copy the code from **Booking button**.

Either way, you can paste the code to an **Embed** or **Text** content area, using the HTML button **</>** in the latter case.
