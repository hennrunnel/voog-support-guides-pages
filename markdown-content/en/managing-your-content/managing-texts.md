As you're adding text to your Voog page, you'll probably want to adjust its style. You can make changes in your website's design with our [design editor](/support/your-websites-design/voog-design-editor) tool, but with the help of our text editing toolbar, you can micromanage your texts.

## Text style and formatting

Our toolbar offers you all of the basic styling features â€“ change your font style into bold, italic or underline it with just one click.  
   
You can also format your text style as a title, heading, subheading, normal text and fixed width. They all have their own font size and weight. In addition, you can always type in a necessary font size to its size panel.

## Colouring and highlighting text

When you're looking to either colour or highlight your text, use our colouring tool to activate a palette.

## How do I add a link or an e-mail address as a link to my text?

Use the underlined **Abc** button for creating links. See the [Creating links](/support/managing-your-content/creating-links) chapter to learn more on how to create links in detail.

## Aligning text

It's possible to align your text to left, centre and right by clicking on the desired alignment button on the toolbar. In case you'd like to remove the alignment, click again on the active alignment option and it will be disabled.

## Listing options

![Highlighted section of the listing buttons on the text toolbar.](https://media.voog.com/0000/0036/2183/photos/managing_texts_5_block.png "Highlighted section of the listing buttons on the text toolbar.")

Our toolbar offers to list your text with either points or enumeration. To list a text that has been already typed in, select it and click on the preferred listing style.   
  
 If you're just starting to type in a list, activate it by clicking on the list style of your choosing and it will be automatically applied to every new row. When you're done, disable it by clicking on the currently active listing style.

## Table editor

## Map tool
