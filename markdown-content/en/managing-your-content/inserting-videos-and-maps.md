## How do I add videos to my Voog site?

![Video content area.](https://media.voog.com/0000/0036/2183/photos/inserting-videos-and-maps-1_block.png "Video content area.")

Begin by clicking on the plus sign and add a **Video** content area to your Voog page. As you click on it, a new window will appear where you can insert your video URL.

  

Once you paste the URL into this field, a preview window will also appear under the tool. If the preview displays the correct video that you'd like to add to your site, click **Insert** and it will be added to your website.

Alternatively, you can also add a video to your Voog page from the text toolbar. To do that, you'll first have to be in the **Text** content area.

Then, click on the movie icon on the toolbar, enter your video URL and a preview of the video will appear under the toolbar. Click **Insert** to add it to your text area.

NB! We suggest embedding videos from such sites as Youtube, Vimeo, Dailymotion, Metacafe etc., as opposed to uploading them to your **Files** menu on your Voog site.

Streaming videos from a dedicated host always guarantees that the video quality and streaming speed will be as good and fast as possible.

## How do I add a Google Map to my site?

Click on the plus sign where you wish to place the map and select the **Map** content area. Type the location you wish to display in the search bar.

![Map content area.](https://media.voog.com/0000/0036/2183/photos/Map_content_area_block.webp "Map content area.")

Once you've done that, click on **Insert** and the map will be added to your page.

Alternatively, you can also add a Google Map to your page from the text toolbar. To do that, you'll first have to be in the **Text** content area.

![Highlighted map icon on the text toolbar.](https://media.voog.com/0000/0036/2183/photos/managing_texts_7_block.png "Highlighted map icon on the text toolbar.")

Then, click on the map icon on the toolbar, enter your location address and when the location is found, just click on **Insert**. We recommend using this method if you need to change the size of your map â€” add the map from your text editor toolbar, click on it and drag its size like a picture.
