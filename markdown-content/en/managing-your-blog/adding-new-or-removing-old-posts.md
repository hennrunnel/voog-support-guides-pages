## How can I create a new blog?

Creating a new blog basically means creating a new page. To do that, make sure you're logged in to your Voog site in edit mode.

Create a new blog by going to the **Content > Structure** menu. You will land on a page where all your current pages are listed.

Click on the **Add new page** button and again, you'll be asked to name the page and to create a blog. Choose **Blog & News** as the layout.

## How do I write a new entry on my blog?

If you'd like to add a new entry to your blog, go to the blog site and you should see a **+ New Post** button underneath the main menu.

Alternatively, you can also add a new post by first opening the **Content > Blogs** menu and by then clicking on the **Add new Blog post** icon.

Either way, you'll be directed to the article editor, where you can start writing your new blog post. After you have finished writing the draft of your post, you can publish it by clicking on **Publish it** at the top of the page.

To read in-depth about the title, excerpt and body fields in the article editor, please see the [Start your first blog with Voog](/support/managing-your-blog/starting-your-first-blog-with-voog) chapter.

## How do I change my blog post?

Find the blog post you wish to modify and click on it and add all of the necessary changes. Do not forget to save changes. If your article is already published, all new changes are automatically published as well.

## How do I delete a post from my blog?

Once you've landed on the blog article that you wish to remove, click on the page settings icon on the lower-right side of the Voog panel (next to the **Preview** button).

You will be directed to a settings box where it's possible to delete the current article with the recycle bin icon at the bottom right corner. When you're completely sure that you'd like to delete the article, click on the delete button and confirm it.

**NB! There is no option to recover deleted blog articles!**
