Voog offers an option to add a free [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/) certificate to your website.

  
  

When you have followed the SSL certificate video guide, then it can take up **to 24 hours** for the certificate to activate. You can check whether the certificate is active by typing your website address to the browser URL with https:// prefix, for example, https://mywebsite.com.

If the certificate is applied, you can force SSL and make sure the secure connection is always used on your website. Go to **Settings > Domains** menu and open the domain settings. Select **Force SSL > Always use SSL**.
