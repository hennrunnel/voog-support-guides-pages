You can pick one of three subscription plans in Voog. All of these include the web store functionality.  
  
**Voog Standard** provides you with everything to get your first website up and running. You may add a personal domain and personalize your website. 5 GB of storage space and much more is included.  
  
With **Voog Plus**, you get some more advanced features to take your website to the next levelâ€”the number of pages, products and users is unlimited; the storage space is raised to 20 GB and SEO and database tools are available for complex use cases.  
  
**Voog Premium** provides you with all the options Voog has to offer. You can use custom SSL certificates, storage space is unlimited and you get access to the redirection engine with full regular expression support. As a premium member, your customer support requests will be prioritized.  
  
For comparison of the plans, see the [Pricing](/pricing) page.  
  
You may change your plan any time you wish. This way you will only pay for the features you use and need. If you change your plan while your subscription is active, you will be credited for the time left on your previous subscription. You can use this credit to purchase a new subscription.
