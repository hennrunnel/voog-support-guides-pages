After you have made a payment, an invoice is generated automatically. You can download your invoices by navigating **Settings > Billing > Invoices** (from the top).

Note that invoices are available only for users with admin rights, and users with editor roles can not access them.

**NB! Please do not use your previous invoices or any information from them for new bank transfers.**
