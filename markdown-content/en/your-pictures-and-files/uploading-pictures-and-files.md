How can I upload files into my Voog 'Files' menu?Uploading your documents, images and other files to your Voog site is quite simple. Just open the Files menu and click on the Upload icon. A browser will open with which you can select your files from your computer and then initiate the uploading process by clicking Open. Alternatively, you can also drag and drop your files from your computer into the Files menu.
A half-transparent circle indicates the current upload process per file with a circular motion. Once the circle has disappeared from the thumbnail of the file, it has been successfully uploaded. How can I remove files from my Voog 'Files' menu?If you'd like to remove any files from your Voog Files menu, simply hover over the image with your cursor and you'll see a bin icon on the lower-right side of the thumbnail. When clicked, the file will be deleted.Can I upload text files?Absolutely! The best way is to upload them under your Files menu first and link it to a selected word in your text field. Instead of a website link, start typing the name of your pdf and insert it.
Is there a size limit for one upload session? Yes, it's possible to upload up to 50 MB of file size per one session. In case you're looking to upload bigger files, we suggest hosting them on another host and simply linking them on your Voog webpage instead.What other functions does the Voog 'Files' menu have?Search engineIf you have a long list of files and no time to browse through them all, simply write your file name into the Search... field on the left side of the Files menu and our system will find it for you.CollectionsTo make your file management even easier, we also provide an option to easily create collections of your files.
