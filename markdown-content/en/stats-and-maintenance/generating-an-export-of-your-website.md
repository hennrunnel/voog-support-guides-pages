Before any major changes, it's always wise to generate a backup version of your site. NB! Exporting your website is only possible with the Plus package or above.  
  
To do this, simply open up your structure view from **Content > Structure**. Then, scroll down to the bottom of the first structure, where you'll see the link **Want to download the entire site?**.

![Cursor pointing at 'download the entire site?' link.](https://media.voog.com/0000/0036/2183/photos/Download_entire_site_block.webp "Cursor pointing at 'download the entire site?' link.")

You will be directed to our site download view, where you'll be able to initiate the backup. It usually takes a couple of minutes so feel free to leave the page â€” we will notify you via e-mail once the backup has been successfully generated.

To download the backup, simply click on the zip icon in the menu and you're good to go!
