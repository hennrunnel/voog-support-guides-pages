I want to know more about your backup and uptime service level.We do a full backup every 24 hours and run constant data replication to be extra sure that no data will be lost if something major happens. Outages and incidents are part of the online world and no one can guard against them 100%, but we're doing all the right things to keep Voog up and running 99.9% of the time. So far, we've been successful.
