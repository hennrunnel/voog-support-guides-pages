Can you take your single website to your own server?You can download your website and move it to any server you want. However, this means that you are not able to edit your website like in Voog and it will stay static. However, we do have made some exceptions by creating a separate instance on other servers. If you are a big national enterprise and would like to see your corporation running on Voog on your very own server, then write to us at sales@voog.com.Is there an option for white-label?Indeed, there is. Several hosting companies are using Voog as their website builder service and we are more than happy to discuss further options. Contact our sales team for more information.
