## How do I access submitted form entries?

You can view submitted form data by navigating to **Content > Forms**. In this view, you’ll see all forms that have been added to the site — even those that have been removed.  
  
 Each form row in the **Forms** view shows:  

- **Page** – shows which page the form is added to. Clicking on the **Page** arrow icon below **View form** will take you to the page where the form is added.
- **Tickets count** – clicking on the **View tickets** arrow icon will take you to the tickets page, where you can see all posts submitted through this form.
- **Submit emails** – displays the email address(es) where new tickets notifications are sent.
- **Created at** – shows the date when the form was added to the site.

## Editing a form

Clicking on a form row opens the **Edit form** window where you can change the form name, add or remove recipient email addresses for submission notifications and delete the form.  

## Tickets

In **Content > Forms > Tickets** view you can see the content of each form submission.  

## Filtering tickets

In the **Content > Forms > Tickets** view, you can use the **Filter** button to:  

- **filter submissions by form name.**
- **filter out spam or regular posts** using the **Spam** filter – Voog also applies intelligent detection to automatically classify suspicious content as spam.
- **filter entries by a specific date range** to view submissions from a particular time period.

## Download all tickets submitted via form

In the **Content > Forms > Tickets** view, you can download all submitted form entries in .xls format.  
 To do this, check the box in front of the relevant form(s), then click the three-dot icon in the top-right corner of the page and select **Export XLS** from the dropdown menu.

## Connect a form to your email address

You can set up form notifications to be sent to your email address in two ways — either directly on the page or via the **Forms** view.

- **Via the page** – go to the page where the form is added and click the gear icon at the top center of the form. In the **Receive entries to email** field, enter your email address. Once saved, all submissions made through this form will be sent to the specified email address automatically.
- **Via the Forms view** – go to **Content > Forms** and click on the form you want to connect to an email address. This opens the **Edit form** window, where you can enter the desired email address in the **Receive entries to email** field.
