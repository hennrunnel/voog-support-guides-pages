Adding a new language to your siteClick on the  Add button in the language menu.
First, choose a preferred language from the Language name drop-down menu and then type in the name you'd like it to appear in the language menu to the Name in menu field.If you'd like the web browser to detect the user language preference by location, choose to Detect by location from the Which language visitors see? field. Alternatively, you may also select this language as a default for all visitors. The region will help you display the country's flag preference on your website. NB! The availability of the Region setting depends on which standard design you have chosen.
The second way to build a new version of your site in another language is by going to Content > Structure and choosing Add language at the menu's header. Then, again choose a preferred language, give it a menu name, set the language detection on or off and lastly, add a website title in this new language.Translating your pages into other languagesTranslated pages are bound to each other. If a visitor changes the language of your site, then they are redirected to the translated version of the same page in the selected language.
There are two ways to translate a page. All your untranslated pages are greyed out in your site's main menu.
Click on the untranslated page name to open an Add a new page menu asking you to type in the page title. You can also change its address if necessary and pick the preferred layout.The alternative way to translate a page into a new language is to go to Content > Structure.  Choose the language you want to translate into from the upcoming menu.
Choose your preferred language from the top panel and expand the list to see all the pages on your new site. You'll see the Untranslated note next to each page that still needs to be translated.Once you click on it,  the Add a new page popup opens, where you'll have to give the page a title, manage its URL and select a layout.Removing a language from your websiteIf you'd like to delete an existing language from your Voog website, go to Content > Structure, select the preferred language that you'd like to delete from the header menu, and then click on the bin icon behind the Language name field.
When clicked, a window will pop up to ask for your confirmation. You can confirm it by selecting OK or not proceed by selecting Cancel.NB! Deleting a language environment also deletes ALL content and pages in this language. Remember that there has to be at least one language left for your site to be accessible to others.If you have accidentally removed the only language from your site, write to us at support@voog.com, and we will help you recover your site.

How do I change the title or language code of an existing language?First, go to Content > Structure and select the preferred language that you'd like to manage from the header menu.
Clicking the Language name field opens a drop-down menu, where you can pick the language you want to duplicate and translate your web page to. This is important, as this setting will affect which flag will be displayed on the language menu for your visitors.From the Name in menu field, you'll be able to change the title that this language is displayed within the language menu.Is this language publicly visible? gives you an option to opt out of any languages you don't want to display. This is a useful tool if you are still expanding your site into different languages and don't want your customers to go to half-done pages.NB! If you opt out of all the languages in your language menu, your webpage will not be accessible for visitors (as browsers are restricted to use any of the languages possible — the page will not be displayed). This will return a "Page not found" error.Which language do my visitors see? The menu allows you to select the current language as a default for all the guests or lets the preference be detected by location. You can read more about it here.Last, give the website a new name from the Website title field and once you've finished with the changes, click the Save button from the Voog user interface and your changes will be applied.

Then, drag it to the approximate preferred location. A blue line will assist you, pointing out all of the available nearby locations for this particular content area.
To place it, release the dragged area and it will be dropped into the slot where the blue line indicated. Please note that the content area text style might change when it's moved from one area to another. That happens because of the different style attributes of a certain content area but it's always possible to change it with the text toolbar.

To make forms as flexible as possible, you can build forms with various field types: text fields, listings, checkboxes, single choice fields and also file upload fields. And what is best, you can mix different field types within a single form. This way you can create a single form to gather all the information you need from your visitors.
Every form has a Google reCAPTCHA v3 spam filter turned on by default. It helps to make sure that only humans can submit form posts. You can choose to turn off the filter from the form settings, although we don’t recommend it.

When you've browsed through our templates upon signing up for your Voog site, you might have noticed that we offer a range of carefully crafted, blog-oriented designs.These responsive, mobile-friendly templates are ideal for creating your first blog and sharing your posts with all of your friends on different platforms.
All our standard designs – except Faro – feature a sample blog which you may find as part of your website after you've signed up. One simple way to start up your own blog is by simply editing or removing these sample posts.You can do that once you've logged into your Voog site edit-mode. Simply open the article by clicking on its header in the blog menu, and you'll be directed to the article editor. Alternatively, you may also access your blog posts when you open on the Content > Blogs menu in the Voog user interface.
You will be directed to a page where all your different blogs are listed in the header of the menu. Once you've selected your preferred blog, you will see all the posts listed under it.Also, you can access all the comments from the same menu. Learn how to manage them here.Writing your first blog post We've divided the editor as following - title, excerpt and body field. When writing a blog title, feel free to start off with a working title or just leave it empty. Once you spark up an idea, try to keep in mind all the different aspects of a good title - it should engage with the content and live up to its expectations because nobody wants to read an article with a completely misleading title. If possible, add a keyword in the title but don't overdo it. You'll have a chance to do that in greater detail in the excerpt, and again, it might leave a bad impression on the reader if the title is too busy. The excerpt is a short introduction or summary of the article ahead, usually written with the intent to attract the reader to the full article. Take a look at how newspapers or books use excerpts to invite more readers, and try to apply these techniques to your own article writing skills. The body consists of the traditional elements - the introduction, the main story and the conclusion. This is completely up to you to write down all of the compelling stories as we stand behind you with our responsive and visually elegant blog designs.Adding images to your blog post Don't forget to illustrate your posts with some nice images that relate to the content and invite readers to even further concentrate on your story. You can read more about using images on your website in our blog post as well. If you're in need of some relevant images for your blog post, here are some great royalty-free databases: https://www.pexels.comhttps://unsplash.comhttps://stocksnap.io NB! Always make sure to read the terms of use of the image you'd like to use. If necessary, contact its owner and ask for permission, too. This is a great way to avoid any misunderstandings in the future.

# Use tags for your blog

What are tags and how can they improve your blog?Simply put, tags are keywords that help categorise your articles and easily find different topics within your blog. In a way, the tag system works as a search engine because once you tag multiple articles with the same tag, they'll become listed and are therefore easily discoverable.We suggest using tags to help readers discover different articles from your blog that they may not find otherwise.Where are tags listed on my Voog blog?
You may find all the tags listed on your blog and article page.How do I add tags to my blog posts?You can find a separate area above each blog post from which you can add tags to your post.Click on the area, type the name of your first tag and hit enter. You can add as many tags as you wish.Voog memorises all the tags you've already added. This helps you a lot when you wish to add the same tags to your next posts. Start typing in the same tag name, and you can see it pops up automatically. Click on the tag and it's done.
For visitors, tags are displayed at the same place where you added them – next to your post.When a visitor clicks on a tag, a list of posts with the very same tag are displayed.

By clicking on a booking, you can see further details of the booking and the customer and you have the option to confirm it.Training spots and Schedule let you add rooms (for example, training rooms if you run a gym) and set a different schedule for each room, respectively.

To place the form right on the page, copy the code from the Booking view box. To create a button, copy the code from Booking button.
Either way, you can paste the code to an Embed or Text content area, using the HTML button </> in the latter case.

To change the width and height of your table, simply click on one of the cells in your table and you should see two dots appearing on the sides of it - one on the right side to configure width and one on the bottom to configure height.Editing the table
As you've created a new table, you might have noticed that new icons appeared on your toolbar.Placing content
You can set your content to appear at the top, in the middle or at the bottom of the table cell with the cell tool.Adding new rows or columns
To add new rows or columns to your table, click on the  icon on the toolbar and you'll be presented with the following options - above, below, before and after. As you hover over each of these options with your cursor, a green line will indicate on your table where the new cells would be added. Deleting rows or columns
In case you're looking to delete any cells, simply click on the cell that you'd like to remove and select the trash bin icon from the toolbar. A drop-down menu will ask you to choose either Row or Column and the red colour will also indicate to you which of the table cells would be deleted.Merging cells

What are the differences between pages and subpages?You can add two different types of pages to your website at Voog - main pages and subpages.Main pages, by default, are displayed in the main menu. Usually, they contain firsthand information which then may be divided into separate fragments with the help of subpages.The subpage itself usually contains a certain amount of information about a larger topic.For example, if you have created a webpage for your restaurant and added a page specifically for courses, you'll probably need to use subpages to help divide it into smaller options such as side dish, main course and dessert.How do I add a new page or subpage to my site?Click on the  Add icon in your main menu to add a new page to the menu.
Adding a subpage is similar — just find it in the menu of a page. The placement of this button varies with design.
Once you've clicked either of these buttons, a new page form will show up where you can add the page a title, set its address, choose the layout and decide if you want to display it in the menu or not.
How do I remove a page from my site?If you'd like to remove a page or a subpage from your website, you have two different options.
The first one is to open page settings from the lower-right side of your Voog panel and click on the recycle bin icon at the bottom right corner of the page settings window.
The second one is to simply proceed to the Content > Structure menu. You will arrive at the site structure, where you'll be able to delete a preferred page by clicking on the trash bin icon behind it.

As you're adding content to your Voog site, it's always good to have an option to reorder your pages if necessary.
To do that, open the menu Content > Structure. You will be directed to a page where all of the pages and their subpages are listed.
Click on the page that you'd like to reorder and simply drag it to its desired position. Keep the mouse button pressed while you're dragging the item.
If you'd like to move a page to the first submenu level or away from it, first click on the small arrow icon next to the title of the page. As you do that, all of the submenus of the current page will be listed. Again, simply drag and drop the pages where necessary.
In case you're looking to move a page as a subpage of a submenu, drag your page onto the submenu. It will be indicated with blue colour instead of with a blue line.
After you've completed making changes in the site structure, make sure you also click on the save icon at the lower right side of your Voog menu.NB! Our templates display only up to two levels of menus by default.

All Voog subscriptions (including the 30-day Trial) support e-commerce on your site, so - building an online store has never been easier. To get started, add your store's general information and products, set up shipping and payment methods, and customize checkout fields if necessary.  Follow the steps below to configure the necessary settings and launch your store. You’ll find all the required information by clicking Store > Settings on the toolbar at the bottom of the screen.
Setting up general store informationYou’ll find your store’s general information under Store > Settings > Store information. Make sure to complete all fields marked with an asterisk (*) for your store to be visible to website visitors. From the Store information view, you can: enter or edit your store details and addressconfigure invoice detailsadd, edit, or remove VAT ratesmanage your store visibility by choosing whether it’s fully active with sales enabled, visible only for showcasing products, or the store is completely inaccessible to the public. Adding shipping methodsTo add shipping methods, go to Store > Settings > Shipping methods. Here you can add suitable options — either automatically updated pick-up points lists (Omniva, DPD, SmartPosti) or custom shipping methods (e.g., courier, pick up your parcel yourself). You can find more details in the shipping guide. Shipping labels and automatic data exchange You can enable automatic data exchange for downloading shipping labels directly from your Voog order view. This applies to Omniva, DPD, and SmartPosti services. Setting up payment methodsBy default, invoice payment is enabled. You can also add the following payment methods:Voog PaySwedbank e-commerce paymentsMaksekeskus payment optionsMontonioPayPalEveryPay  These can be configured under Store > Settings > Payments. Learn more in the payment methods guide. Adding productsWhen you add a new product to your store, a product page is automatically generated in all site languages. You can access (and view) these automatically generated product pages in two ways:through product list view.Via a direct link, which you can find in the Edit product view, under the Locations section. There, the address of the product page is displayed — by clicking the arrow icon next to it, the product page will open in a new view.
You can add products in three ways: Product management view — add and manage products via the Products view. Learn more about using the product management view.Products content area — add products directly in the page content where they will be displayed. Learn how to add products using the Products content area. Importing products from a file — if you're dealing with a larger quantity of products, importing them from a file is a convenient and efficient way to add them all at once. This method allows you to save time by uploading multiple products in bulk, rather than adding each one manually. Learn more in the product import guide. Important information when adding products:Product variants — variations allow you to add different options to the same product, such as sizes, colors, etc. Read how to add product variants.Stock value — helps track inventory and prevent stockouts. More info in the stock management guide.Product categories — products can be placed in different categories (e.g. clothes, shoes, handbags, etc.) to make the store clearer and easier to navigate for customers. Learn to assign product categories. Customer notificationsAs the store owner, you will receive a notification of every new order. Your store system sends automated email notifications to the customer in the following cases: When the customer selects invoice payment  — an order confirmation with a PDF invoice is sent to the customer.When the order has been successfully paid (including via bank link or other online payment methods) — a payment confirmation is sent to the customer. Read more about email notifications. Customizing checkout fieldsGo to Store > Settings > Checkout to add, remove, or modify checkout form fields.Learn more about customizing checkout fields. Terms and refund policyTo ensure a trustworthy and transparent shopping experience, your cart should include a link to your store’s terms and refund policy page. This allows customers to review important information before completing their purchase. If you don’t have your own terms yet, you can use Voog sample templates as a starting point. You’ll find them in your store under Store > Settings > Store information, next to the Communication section. To set this up:Create a new hidden page on your sitePaste and customize the sample termsHide the page from the menuCopy the page URL and add it to Store > Settings > Store information next to the Communication section  See the guide how to create a terms of service page link. Test order and order managementBefore going live, make a test order to ensure everything (emails, payments, notifications) works properly. After a test order, we recommend: Mark the order as canceled — this is useful when you want to cancel the order yourself for any reason. Cancelling an order will release the product reservation, making the item available for purchase again.Archive the order — helps keep your order list clean and organized. See the guide on managing orders. Please note that all transactions with the payment status Paid are included in the e-commerce transaction fee calculation. If you cancel an order, no transaction fee will be charged for that transaction. Read more about how e-commerce transaction fee is calculated.ReportsSales reports are valuable for every shop owner.

If you wish, you can add more than one product image to the product. Please note that the first image is always set as the main image of the product - it is displayed first in the product list view and the product detail view.

If you are in the product detail view, click on the three dots on the top right. In the menu that opens, select Duplicate.

View your ordersYou can see and manage your orders when you open Store > Orders. If you’ve inserted the Store notification email address upon setting up your store you’ll also receive email notifications for each new order.
The general orders view gives you basic information about each order, such as in the image above. Click on any order to see more information about it. This includes billing and shipping information and order details, which lists all ordered items and their prices.
Updating ordersYou can modify the following information for customer orders:Billing Information: Update the contact details entered during the checkout process. Note that if the shipping information uses the same details entered during checkout, making changes here will not affect the shipping information.Shipping Information: Change the shipping address or parcel machine selection. However, you cannot modify the shipping method.Note: Add or edit notes related to the order.To make these changes, navigate to the order details page and look for the Edit button next to each relevant section. Clicking on this button will open a panel on the right side of the screen, where you can make the necessary adjustments.
Filtering and exportUse the Filter button on the upper right corner of the orders view to display orders based on specific criteria. You can filter orders by date, sum, payment and shipping status and by customer’s name or e-mail. It’s also possible to filter by whether or not the orders are archived. We'll get back to archiving below.
By clicking the three dots beside the Filter button, you can download your orders in XLS or CSV format. In addition, you can choose CSV with items in which case individual products are listed in separate rows. If you prefer, you can export only selected orders by applying filters first or ticking the boxes of the desired orders.Archive your old ordersIt's a good idea to archive your old orders so they don't clutter your order list view. NB! You can’t delete your orders. That’s because you may need to look up an old order and by archiving, you’ll always have access to them.
To archive an order, simply click the three dots at the end of the row and select Archive. To view archived orders, use filtering. You can also unarchive orders at any time by selecting Unarchive by the three dots.Order statusesTo better keep track of your orders you can use different statuses to indicate the progress of each order. Note that order status also affects inventory management of the products in the order. To manage your orders more efficiently we’ve separated payment and shipping statuses.Payment statuses:Unpaid – the order has been placed by the customer but it isn't paid yet. Generally, this status is only necessary for offline payments, since with other payment methods the payment is made during checkout. An order paid through a bank link or with a credit card is in Unpaid status until the payment is completed. If it stays in that status, it’s most likely caused by a redirecting error between bank and merchant or the customer has abandoned the order halfway through payment. NB! Orders paid with an offline invoice need to be manually changed to "Paid" because the customer makes a payment directly to your bank account and Voog doesn't get notified of this.Paid – the order has been placed and is paid. NB! When an order is placed the products are “booked”, regardless of whether the order is in “Unpaid” or “Paid” status.Pending – this status is displayed for payments with a bank link or a credit card when the initial validation for the payment is completed. You can also use this status for orders with offline invoice as needed.Cancelled – this status you can also apply yourself in cases when a customer has requested to cancel their order or when you choose to cancel an unpaid order that you consider overdue. Cancelling an order removes the “booking” and the “booked” products become available again.
Shipping statuses:Not fulfilled – by default the shipping status of a new order is Not fulfilled.Fulfilled – once you’ve shipped an order you can change it to Fulfilled. This removes the “booking” and also removes these units from the inventory.
Shipping labelsIf you turn on automatic data exchange, you can generate shipping labels for Omniva, DPD and SmartPosti orders directly on Voog.
You can download the order’s shipping label via the Print shipping label button in order details view.The shipping label is supported if:You have set up and activated the integration of a delivery service provider (Omniva, DPD, SmartPosti).The customer has placed an order where the chosen delivery method is Omniva, DPD or SmartPosti.The buyer's name and phone number are filled in on the order.More information about automatic data exchange and how to activate it with Omniva, SmartPosti, and DPD.Important information about the shipping label:The name of the store entered in the store settings is marked as the sender of the package on the shipping label.The return address will be the one entered in the store settings.In order to create a shipping label, it is necessary to mark the buyer's name and telephone fields as mandatory in the shopping cart. Shopping cart fields can be edited in Store settings > Checkout view.After making the necessary changes to an order, you can regenerate the shipping label with the updated information and download it.
Bulk actionsWith bulk actions, you can save time and update multiple orders at once in Voog. Here's how:1. To select multiple orders, put a checkmark in front of the rows of orders that you want to change at once. To select all orders, check the box in front of the column headings.2. Click on the Edit button to change the status of selected orders.
3. You can change the payment status (paid, pending, unpaid, or cancelled), shipping status (not fulfilled or fulfilled), and order status (not archived or archived) for all selected orders.

Simply put a checkmark in front of the orders you want to download the invoices or shipping labels for, click on the three dots icon, and select Download PDF invoices or Download shipping labels. Note that shipping labels will only be printed for orders that already have generated shipping labels - these orders will have a truck icon beside the shipping status in the orders view.

Tips for successful product importing General Importing can be done within the confines of a single language at a time - translations of names must be imported separately.If you choose to update products, for a product with variations, the variations of the product being updated that are not present in the import file will be removed. Import fileThe import file can contain a maximum of 10,000 lines.The size of the import file can be up to 10 MB.Supported file formats: XLSX, ODS, CSV.For the successful import of a new product without variations, a minimum of two columns are needed - product name and prices.For importing a product with variations, the import file must contain a row for the main product followed by rows for the variations, i.e., a minimum of 4 columns - ID, Parent ID, Name, Price. Product import file templates You can use an export file downloaded from your website, our sample templates, or create the file as a template for your import file. Fields supported in import file during import When importing a product, the following fields  related to the product are supported for import:ID – the product identifier, used for product updates and importing products with variations.Parent ID – on the product variation line, the ID of the associated main product, is used for importing variations.Product code – the product code (SKU, etc.).Name – the product name in the respective language (ignored for product variation line).URL slug – part of the product URL, for example, in /en/products/my-product it would be my-product (only the main product line value is considered during import).Variant attributes – variation types associated with the product variation, in the form Size: S, Color: Black (comma is used as the dimension separator and colon as the value separator).Description – The product description in the respective language (ignored for product variation line).Price – the net price of the product/variation in the store's currency (mandatory for the main product, optional for variation).Sale price – the net reduced price of the product/variation in the store's currency (optional for both main product and variation).Stock – available quantity, if empty, then unlimited stock quantity.Status – visibility of the product/variation (allowed values Live/Draft).Categories – categories associated with the product in the respective language, separated by commas (e.g., Lamps, Another Cat) (empty value removes categories, ignored for product variation line).Meta description - when you share the link of your product page on social media, you can add an appropriate product description known as the OG description (Open Graph Description).Length – the length of the product in meters.Width – the width of the product in meters.Height – the height of the product in meters.Weight – the weight of the product in kilograms. When you download the export file of existing products from your website, you can access the column names similarly. Import file structure The import file consists of a header row followed by rows of products to be imported. To facilitate the automatic detection of column types, we recommend using the same field names as described in the supported import fields section. Import of products without variations - each product is on a separate line. Minimum columns are “Name” and “Price” upon creation, and “ID”, “Name” and “Price” for updating.Import of products with variations - there are 2-N rows for each product. The first row, or the main product row (matrix), contains the basic information of the product (e.g., name, URL, categories, default price). The following rows are the product variation rows, where the value in the "Parent ID" must match the value in the "ID" column of the main product. Product import processNavigate to Store > Products view, click on the three dots at the top corner of the page, and in the menu that opens, choose Import products.
Note that for importing products, all added information must be in the correct format and structure. If at least one product (which could be a single product, or a main product  variations) does not validate or is faulty, the entire import will be canceled. However, under certain conditions, a row will be ignored. For example, if the first row is immediately a variation row and its main product row is missing, then the variation row will be ignored, and the import will start with the first main product if it is found in the following rows.On the opened Import Products page, you can upload the file to be imported (preferably XLSX, ODS).Before importing products, please familiarize yourself withsample import fileinformation on importing translatable fieldsChoose the language in which you want to import products.Set the matches between columns and product fields.After uploading the import file, you will be shown all the columns found in the file, the content of their first 4 rows, and an option to decide if and how each column is imported as a field. Note that only columns with an assigned field will be imported.When you click on the Start import button, the system will notify you that the product import has been initiated. Once the import task is completed, you will receive an email notification that the product import is finished. Notifications are sent for both successful and unsuccessful imports.If you close the Import products view, you will see an "X imports" menu next to the filter button in the Products list view, where you can see the completed and in-progress/queued import tasks. Importing product translations If your website has more then one language, they need to be imported in the language set in the Import products view. If you want to import product translations (for example Name, URL slug, Description) in bulk, follow these steps: Download or export the desired products.In the downloaded file, retain only the columns ID, Parent ID, Name, URL slug, Description.Translate these into the language of the downloaded file.In the Import products view, select another language into which you wish to import the products.In the Import products view, select Overwrite existing products with matching ID. Important information after product import In the Products view, import tasks are regularly updated if a task is currently in progress. Note that if the product import is completed and you are in the product list view, the product list will reload. Be aware that if something goes wrong during the import (for example, if a row fails), then the entire change will be rolled back and no products will be imported.

# Organize your store structure

How to display products on a page?
In the Products content area, you can display all your store products or only products from a specific category. To distinguish between categories, you should first assign categories to your products. You can have countless product categories and create a separate Products content area for each category if you wish. You can place them on the same page, create a separate page for each, or combine them in any other way.
You can add a Products content area like any other type of content area by clicking on the plus sign on the page - in the popup window, select Products.
By default, the content area displays all your store products (excluding products in Draft status - they are hidden from public view). In the Products content area, you can add, delete, and modify products.
Creating Multiple Categories
If you have a larger store and want to organise your products into categories, it's best to use separate Products content areas for different product categories and arrange them on one or multiple pages to clearly differentiate product groups.
When using multiple product content areas, you can filter your preferred category or categories in each content area. Here is a guide on how to set categories in the Products content area.
Below are some examples of how you can structure your store:
Create subpages for your main store page. You can display all products on the main page and specific category products on subpages. This way, the submenu acts as a product category filter. This solution can be seen in the Reykjavik sample store, where the left column allows you to choose product categories "Sailing Ships" and "Accessories".
You can visually separate product categories on a single page as well. For example, you can insert Text content areas with subheadings between Products content areas, as done in the Boulder sample store.
You can also create a combined version of the two, where the main store page displays products in a grid, and subpages list individual category products. This solution is used in the Nuuk sample store.
While the previous examples feature a store as a single menu item, you can actually turn your entire website into a store, with the product selection opening on the home page. This way, you can create a product category selection in the main menu and, if desired, also add a blog and contact page. This is how the Sapporo sample store is built, where the home page displays all products, and the top menu allows navigating to product categories.
Product List Appearance
You can change the appearance of the product list by opening the product list settings and going to the Design tab. The Template provides four design options.
Grid
If you have many products and want a classic, orderly layout, you can arrange them in a grid and choose how many columns they appear in on a computer screen and how many columns in mobile view. Both can be set separately.
Masonry
In a mosaic layout, products are also arranged in columns, but the product images retain their original aspect ratio and may vary in height. The number of columns for both computer and mobile screens can be changed separately. Mosaic works well if you want an artistic arrangement for your products, with variously sized images fully visible.
List
If you have fewer products and want a more spaced-out layout, you can arrange them in a list. This displays product descriptions alongside the images, providing more information to the customer without them having to click on the product.
Catalogue
If you want to display your products in large, side-by-side images, you can use the panorama layout. Products are placed in a single row with large, clearly visible images. You can scroll the product row left or right using arrows. Item width and height allow you to adjust the size of the product images in the list view.

What is SEO?
SEO or Search Engine Optimization makes your website visible in search engine results without paying for ads. It is combined with the page titles, descriptions and content you have added to the website.
Submit website to Google
Before sharing your website with the world, ensure you've added page descriptions and images, as they are crucial for sharing on platforms like Google and Facebook. Once ready, submit your domain to Google Search Console URL Crawler to add your site to Google.
Google adds new sites to their index and updates existing ones every time they crawl the web. If you have a new URL, tell them about it through the previous link.Note that they won't add all submitted URLs to their index, and we can't make predictions or guarantees about when or if submitted URLs will appear in their index.Google also asks for your website sitemap. This is necessary so the Google robots can scan and index your site structure in the search engine. If you've built your website with Voog, it's already available to them, and you don't have to take any extra steps to submit it.
Setting up Google Search Console with Voog
Google Search Console, formerly Google Webmaster Tools, is a free service that helps you monitor and maintain your site's presence in Google Search results. Signing up can help you understand how Google views your site and optimize its performance in search results.
You must have a Google account and personal domain address to join the Google Search Console. Then add your website address as a property in the console. Of course, Google asks for verification to confirm that you own the website listed.
Choose URL prefix as the verification method, which should give you a similar code: googlef52f1d814b8972e9.html.
Log in to your Voog account and navigate to the following directory: Content > SEO > Integrations. Scroll down to find the Google Search Console verification code field and enter the Google Search Console verification code.
Google also offers another free service called Google Webmaster Tools (GWT).We recommend using it because it allows you to:
Submit your site to Google
Control updating rate and force Google to revisit your site (by re-submitting your sitemap.xml file)
See when Google has visited and indexed your site
See how users reach your site (incoming links and keywords)
Get Google's view of your site
Diagnose problems (broken links, duplicated page title)Future tasks — get to the top
Getting indexed by Google is only the first step. Promote your site through popular blogs, websites, and social networks to rank higher. Creating valuable and engaging content increases your chances of being shared and linked.
Some useful links:
Pingomatic blog pinging serviceWhat is SitemapAbout Crawling & IndexingOther search engines: BingWhile Google is the most dominant search engine, consider submitting your website to others like Bing. Check out the necessary steps on how to get started with Bing. Voog doesn't support the XML verification method; we recommend the META-tag method.
I've recently updated my website, but the search engine still displays old info. What to do?
If you've changed your website structure, deleted any pages or even added new ones, it's always good to ask Google to recrawl your website. Check it out — it's a great tool because it updates your website information in search results.
You can read a more detailed guide, "How to remove your website or web page from Google", in our blog.How to remove your whole site or a specific page from Google's search results?Google may index your website in a way that might not suit you best. For example, the search results display a page which is deleted. You can notify Google to delete false information from the search results.If your site is connected to the Google Search Console tool, you must first delete your site or subpages of your site, which you don't want to be visible in the search results, then log on to your Google Search Console account and choose Google Index > Remove URLs from the left menu. If the site hasn't been deleted before, the application will only delete your site from the search engines temporarily – for 90 days. More information about this can be found in our blog post.If you've made changes to your site, you can ask Google to re-index the site by using the Fetch as Google tool.

What is SEO?SEO (Search engine optimization) covers all activities that help your site become visible in organic search results. Organic search results are the unpaid results that appear as a result of a search engine query. Voog includes built-in tools to manage the information available for search engines.SEO Tools in VoogAccess SEO settings by selecting Content > SEO from the main menu. First, you'll see an overview of the following:
Site title — The name of your website, displayed as the title of search results and on the browser tab.Formats — You can specify whether search results and the browser bar display the site name, page title, or both, and in which order (e.g. "My Site - Home").The Visible to search engines switch allows you to hide your site from search engines (noindex), but if your website is ready to go and you wish to have it listed by search engines, make sure that this switch is on.Google Search Console verification code — learn more about Search Console and how it helps with SEO optimization in this guide.Sitemap and RobotsIn Voog, the sitemap.xml and robots.txt files are automatically created.Search engines use the sitemap.xml file to see the structure of your website. If necessary, you can turn off the Sitemap, after which search engines will not know the structure of your website.Please note that by turning off the sitemap, you cannot completely hide your website from search engines, as search engines can still map your website and index your content using internal and external links.Regarding the Sitemap, you can decide whether blog posts, blog tags and automatically generated product pages will be added to the sitemap.The robots.txt file directs search engines to the home page and indicates which part of the page search engines should visit, index, and not. You can customize your robot.txt file on the website if you wish.Including auto-generated product pages in the sitemapYou can also include the automatically generated product pages in the sitemap.Open the Content > SEO > Sitemap view to do this.By default, the setting is off, and automatically generated product page links are not added to the sitemap.To include the automatically generated product pages in your sitemap, you need to ensure that:The products sitemap is enabled (Content > SEO > Sitemap > Show automatically generated product pages in the sitemap).Your Store exists and is activated.The product is in Live status.With these conditions met, the sitemap will include links to the automatically generated product pages.PagesThe Pages tab lists all the pages and subpages of your site, along with titles, descriptions and the page's SEO score as estimated by Voog. Click on a page to open the SEO settings for that page. You can sort the pages by title, description and path or use the search box to apply a filter.
Find out more about page titles and descriptions here.RedirectsIf you wish to share a subpage with a long and clumsy address, or if you've made structural changes to a page, the redirect tool can help.
To create a new redirection rule, click on the New URL button.
Fill in the Old URL field with the address you wish to redirect. It may be an old URL that is no longer valid, but might still be used. You can also create a short address for a subpage with a long address. Visitors will be redirected to the address in the New URL field.The redirects view lists all the redirects you've created and allows to turn these on and off individually. Note that redirects don't work in edit mode — this allows you to access all the pages on your site, some of which would otherwise redirect elsewhere.More SEO tipsSEO keywordsA keyword is a word or a group of words a potential visitor uses to perform a search. A well-optimized website “speaks the same language” as its potential visitor base with keywords that help connect searchers to the site.Choosing the right keywordsChoosing the right keywords is essential to be successful in organic growth. Where to start?  Build a list of topics that match your products, services, and your website's content. Use SEO tools like Google Keyword Planner, Keyword Tool, SEMRush or GrowthBar to identify the search volume for those words and find variations that match best.In analysis, the most important aspect is to monitor the type of keyword, the number of searches per month, and the competition. For a starting website, you should choose less competitive keywords. These are mainly long-tail keywords that consist of three or more words.The more specific your keyword, the more effectively it will work for you. An example of a weak keyword would be “domain” and a good one “domain registration”. An even better keyword would be “domain registration price”, which also indicates the customer's desire to purchase the service. Location-based keywords are also beneficial.Associate one keyword with a page or blog post, mentioning it in the URL, the title, the description of some prominent images, and a few times in the content. Trust your gut instinct, and don't overdo it.To check your SEO score, use SEOptimer.Off-page SEOOff-page SEO comprises efforts taken outside of a website to improve its search engine rankings. Link building, i.e backlinks from other sites to yours, is often considered to be the primary tactic.How to get backlinks?It is essential to ensure that backlinks are of high quality. Low-quality links that are easy to automate, with unnatural patterns and controlled anchor text, have a negative effect on optimization.A high-quality backlink has four features. The link comes from a relevant and trusted page that links to your page for the first time and is a do-follow link made visible to search engines.Options for building backlinks include:Mention on a partner's or client's siteMention on blogs or social mediaMention on a guest postCreating an informative page that people have a reason to mentionYou can also do competitive backlink research by analyzing the backlink profile of your well-ranked competitors.
Use the Backlink Checker tool to check which pages link to your site.

# Edit titles and descriptions

**Section:** SEO

What is a title?Think of your website title as a label for describing the site's content to your potential guest. Not only is it the title in your browser window but also it appears as a header in the search results. Therefore, it's an essential part of your site SEO (search engine optimization) structure.When choosing a title for your website or just for a page, try to keep it around 55 characters max. That's about the average length for the title not to be shortened in the Google search engine.Why are titles necessary?
The title simply states the name of your page in the website menu. You should choose a title with the intention to give your guest an idea of what that page is about. For example, if you have a store set up on your website, name its Shops. We suggest keeping the titles as short as possible because long menu tabs might become unreadable.From the SEO standpoint, titles are important as they are displayed as headers for your page description in the search engine, as well as they are displayed in your website's site map.The different types of titles on your Voog pageWebsite titleIt's important to think about the structure of your website title in the way how it's displayed in the search results. If possible, always add a primary keyword or your company slogan next to the actual name of your website. This helps you stand out in the search results list.Make sure that the primary keyword isn't included in a long sentence and the slogan itself is as self-explanatory as possible.Page titleThe page title should be short, labelling the content of the current page. Unlike the webpage title, it shouldn't contain any further elements such as your company slogan.On the other hand, for example, if you have an e-store and you name your store menu label "Sale", statistics show that it attracts more visits than just "Store". Therefore, it's still crucial to think through how you name your menu items.How do I change my website title?Open the Content > Structure menu and see all of the languages on your site listed. Select one and refer to the 'Website title' field to add or change the site name.How do I change my page title?Refer to the Edit page titles and descriptions chapter in the Managing your website pages menu.What's a description?The description is an informational text that accompanies your website on search engines and social sites. With about 150-160 characters, it should give an overview of your website's main idea or focus. Also, it should be understandable for a guest who doesn't know specific content-related terminology.Why are descriptions necessary?When you've connected your Voog site with Google Search Console, it should begin appearing in Google search results. The information next to your website name in the search engine should be displayed like this - the name, the URL and the description of your website front page. This means that a description represents your site and gives its potential guest a short overlook of what it's all about. Please note that the description of your site's front page is especially important because this will also be added to the search results. Additionally, social sharing sites such as Facebook also display the description along with the shared content from an outer source.Therefore, adding a description is absolutely necessary and if it is set up the right way, it will play its part in gaining your website more traffic.How do I add a description for a page?To learn how to add a description for the pages on your Voog website, please take a look at the Edit page titles and descriptions guide.

Changing swiftly between your Voog sites
Suppose you have registered several websites with one e-mail address. In that case, you can quickly switch between them by opening the Dashboard at the bottom left corner.
If you wish to edit a website that you manage with another e-mail account, you need to log out of the site. For that, click on the rounded icon after your name in the Dashboard. Then proceed to the log-in window https://www.voog.com/login.
Creating a new Voog site quicklyTo register a new site with an existing Voog account, go to Dashboard. In the top right corner of the opened view, you'll find the Add new site button, which you can click to create a new page.
Next, you'll be redirected to our design gallery, where you can choose a suitable design for your developing site. You'll also need to enter a valid password and select a technical address for your site, which will remain the identifying address for your site within our system. Later, you can add alternative, free .voog.com ending domain names or completely personalized domain names (e.g., mycompany.com) to it.

# Add Google Analytics to your website

One of the powerful tools for understanding your website's performance is Google Analytics. This guide explains how to add Google Analytics to your Voog website. Log into your Google account in the Google Analytics environment. Click on the button labelled Get started today, then on Start measuring in the window that appears. Initially, you're allowed to set up your account, and once your initial setup is complete, you will be guided to the Start collecting data view. Here, you should choose the Web as your platform. In the following view, you will be able to input the details of your website. When entering your website's address, use the domain you intend to promote and the https:// prefix.  For instance, if you wish to showcase your website with "mycompany.com", then you should add it to Google Analytics as "https://mycompany.com", not as "mycompany.voog.com" or "https://www.mycompany.com".Once your account is registered, a code, or what is known in Google terms as a global site tag, is generated for you, which would look something like this: <!-- Global site tag (gtag.js) - Google Analytics --><script async src="https://www.googletagmanager.com/gtag/js?id=UA-123456789-1”></script><script>  window.dataLayer = window.dataLayer || [];  function gtag(){dataLayer.push(arguments);}  gtag('js', new Date());  gtag('config', 'UA-123456789-1');</script>Copy the code, go to your Voog page, and choose Settings > Site. Paste your Global Site Tag tracking code into the field of External tracking code and press the Save button below.
Keep in mind that after adding the Google Analytics code to your website, Google may take a few days to activate your account and for you to start seeing results. You can read more about this on Google's official page.For more details about e-shop event tracking, check out this guide.NB! When you add a third-party widget to your site, which gathers user data, the visitors must be aware of that activity. See our guide about cookie notifications here.

Can you take your single website to your own server?You can download your website and move it to any server you want. However, this means that you are not able to edit your website like in Voog and it will stay static. However, we do have made some exceptions by creating a separate instance on other servers. If you are a big national enterprise and would like to see your corporation running on Voog on your very own server, then write to us at sales@voog.com.Is there an option for white-label?Indeed, there is. Several hosting companies are using Voog as their website builder service and we are more than happy to discuss further options. Contact our sales team for more information.

How do I get my site to show up on search engines?
When you have created a brand new website there is no way anybody, even search engines like Google, can know about it. If you feel ready to make your site discoverable by search engines, the easiest way is to use the Google Add URL service. However, for more fine-grained control over Google search results, we recommend using Google Search Console.How to install Google Search Console on your site?First off, make sure you have added a personal domain to your website. Read more about domains from our guide section. Log in to Google Search Console (you'll need a Google account to do this). Add the address of your site (for example, https://mycompany.com) to your account. When the address is added, Google will ask for verification to confirm that you really are the site owner. Choose URL prefix as the verification method, which gives you a code like this: googlef52f1d814b8972e9.html.You can add the verification code to your site in the Site Properties view. Go to Content > SEO. Enter the verification code into the Google Search Console verification code field and click Save. You can then complete the verification process by clicking Verify in your Google Search Console account.
NB. Remember to set up a correct address in your Google Search Console account. If you want to promote your site with an address such as "mycompany.com" then you should add the "mycompany.com" not "mycompany.voog.com".You can read more about this on our blog post on how to make your website show up on Google.
Once your site is indexed, you're halfway there. Probably the best way to get your site to the top of search results is to promote it: get incoming links from relevant, high-quality sites.You can also use Google Analytics, another free service, to get detailed information about your visitors: where they're from, how they get to your site and what they do there. Find out here how to add Google Analytics code to your Voog site.

Statistics – why should you care?Statistics are not just numbers — they can be the centre of your business. A website can be a really important channel for your business and a place for your customers to actually find you. Statistics can therefore help you diagnose whether your website is popular or not. Also, you can get a better overview of who visits your website, where they're from, and what they actually do on your website. Perhaps this makes you realise you need to put more emphasis on certain aspects of your business.Before you see any statistics about your website, we recommend you to make your website known to the world wide web by using Google Search Console. Where can you see the visitor statistics of your site?
Voog has a built-in statistics module that shows general information about your website visitors.
Click on the Stats button from the lower menu bar and choose:Visitors: stats about visitors' origin as well as which browsers and op-systems they use;Content: stats about which pages within your website are most visited ones;Sources: stats about from where your visitors have come from.We also recommend using Google Analytics, which is a free service providing more detailed and accurate statistics. Voog has a built-in mechanism to add Google Analytics to your site, which can be found from the 'Stats' menu. Read about it from here.

Uploading pictures to my Voog siteUploading pictures can be done exactly the same way as uploading any other kind of documents to your Voog site. Just open the Files menu and click on the Upload icon.
A browser will open with which you can select your files from your computer and then initiate the uploading process by clicking Open.Alternatively, you can also drag and drop your files from your computer into the 'Files' menu.How do I add a picture from my files menu into my Voog page?There are two different ways to add a picture to your Voog page. One is by simply adding large images, one at a time, to your content area and the other one is by creating a gallery for multiple images.To learn how to create galleries, see the Picture galleries chapter.To add a large image to your content area, begin adding a Text content area to your page. Then, open the Files menu, find the image and drag it into the previously added content area.
A blue line indicates where your image will be approximately placed. You can also choose the alignment of the image as you place it, note for the small indicators on the blue line. If you place the image either to the left or the right side of the content area, it will be resized to fit next to the text. In case you choose to add it in the middle of the content area, it will be scaled to have 100% of the content area width.Once you have placed the image, you may click on it to activate the image toolbar. It consists of the following tools:Linking tool to make your image into a hyperlink. See our guide about creating links here.Background colour tool to spice up your images with a preferred shade of colour.Moving function for adjusting your image inside a smaller frame than its original size.Title tool for enabling and disabling the image title area.
How can I remove an image from my page?
To remove an image gallery from the rest of the content, simply move on to the content area and click on the recycle bin icon that appears at the top orgrab it from its header and drag it into the little recycle bin icon on the bottom right corner of the page. Just like it works with any other content area on your site!However, if you have the image in a content area that you don't wish to delete as a whole, simply click on the image and press backspace. Just like you would when you edit texts.How to avoid long loading times with image selection?High-resolution images (over 1 megabyte) should be compressed before uploading. There are many programs out there to use, even straight in your browser, such as compressjpeg.com, optimizilla.com and compressor.io.

You can create various different galleries on your website. The Voog gallery tool offers you the following options:GridThe good old basic grid of squares lined up next to each other. In the gallery options, you're able to set a suitable column count which will then automatically fit the grid to the width of your page.Add spacing in between the squares as you see fit.
Slider Display your images in a simple image carousel. Adjust the height and the sliding interval time period inside the gallery options. Add 0 if you don't want the slider to slide automatically.
Wall Display a lot of images over your page in style. You can set a preferred thumbnail size which will adjust the number of images displayed in one line. Set spacing to the images how you see fit.
SquaresIt's an ideal solution for a larger gallery. For example, if you'd like to create a gallery with a lot of images but don't want your visitors to spend too much time scrolling through them, that's the way to go.
Viewing images in full screenClick on the image inside your gallery and it will pop up in the full-screen view.On the upper side of the page, you'll find the title area. The title will be displayed under the image for the visitors. Also, you can see the image in its original size when clicked on the zooming icon and proceed to the full-screen mode without any browser elements.Switch in between the images by clicking on the arrow icons on the sides of the image or simply by clicking on the arrow icons on your keyboard.
How do I add a gallery to my page? Click on the plus sign wherever you wish to place the gallery and select the 'Gallery' content area.
How do I add pictures to my gallery?Open up the Files menu and click on the Upload button, find the images from your computer and confirm them for uploading. Once you have them uploaded, simply click on an image and drag it onto the gallery area you've previously added. Feel free to drag as many images as you need to the gallery — there is no limit. How do I change the order of the images in my gallery?Changing the order of the images in your gallery is fairly simple — just click on the particular image you need to reorder and drag it either left or right.If you have a slider on your page, first scroll to the image you need to reorder and then as explained before, just click on it and drag it where necessary. How do I remove pictures from my gallery?Click on the image that you need to remove and drag it down into the recycle bin icon that appears on the lower right side of your page. NB! Removing images from the galleries won't remove them from the Files menu. If you intend to completely remove an image, open the Files menu, find the image and click on the small recycle bin icon on it.

When can I change my subscription?We think it's only natural that you should be able to choose a plan that fits your needs the most. And even if you have already taken one of our subscriptions, you should have the option to change it whenever needed.What happens to the credit on my account if I change my subscription? Will it be lost?On changing the subscription before it expires you can also keep all the credit left on your account. Here is an example. Let's say you are using Voog Standard plan and you have 6 months left until the expiry date. But now you want Voog Plus. The credit for 6 months left on your account is deducted from your Voog Plus payment, so no money is lost. And it works the same way around if decide to move from Plus to Standard plan.From where can I make the change?To change your subscription, choose Settings > Billing.
In your subscription view, you can see Standard, Plus and Premium plan (with currently active one noted as Current plan). To change your current one, choose either the Upgrade or Downgrade button (depending on which plan is currently active).If you choose to downgrade your subscription, you have to make sure that your website fits into the other plan.

Recurring paymentsIf you’ve paid for your website subscription with a credit card, recurring payments are automatically applied.
As your subscription end date approaches, our system sends you an email to notify you of the next automatic payment. Although your subscription is renewed after your previous subscription has ended, the bank may deduct the required sum as much as 3 days earlier, depending on the payment processing protocols of different financial institutions and whether the period overlaps with weekends or national holidays.Cancel automatic renewalHowever, in case you don’t wish to use the same card for the next payment, or you don’t need to update your website subscription. You can cancel the automatic renewal immediately after making the initial payment.To do that, select Settings > Billing. Your current subscription contains a link to cancel the recurring payments.
You can also do that at Settings > Billing > Invoices.
If the card has expired or has been cancelled due to theft, the payment is not processed, and your subscription is not updated. There may be more reasons for that to happen, but that’s confidential information between you and your bank. To avoid your subscription not being renewed due to out of date card information, we send you an email notifying you of the payment not being processed.NB! Automatic renewal is only applied to website subscriptions. The official regulations of domain registration don’t currently allow the automatic renewal of domain subscriptions.

# Calculate transaction fees for your online store

For both Standard and Plus plans, the transaction fee is 3% of the total sale. However, if you use Voog Pay for your transactions, we won't charge you any commission at all.We calculate the percentage based on the transaction amount (invoice amount including VAT). All online store transactions with a payment status of Paid will be considered – this means that if a customer has left an invoice unpaid or you have cancelled an order, we will not apply the transaction fee for such transactions.Note: There is no transaction fee in the Premium plan and with Voog Pay payments.You can pay the transaction fee based on the invoice we issue when the unpaid transaction fee accumulated by the end of the previous month is at least €30. The invoice will include VAT on top of the transaction fee. Here's a detailed example of the calculation:If a purchase is made in your online store for €50, Voog calculates the transaction fee as follows: 0.03 * €50 = €1.5.In addition, the applicable VAT (20%) is calculated on the transaction fee:0.2 * €1.5 = €0.3.So, the final transaction fee for this sale is€1.5  €0.3 = €1.8.To view a summary of your store's sales and accumulated transaction fees, you can access the online store reports. To do this, open the menu and go to Store > Reports, where you'll see a monthly summary of sales and transaction fees. For a more detailed overview, simply click on a specific row.

I've already paid for my domain a year ago. Why do I have to pay again?Domains (usually) are something you can't buy for a lifetime. Whenever you want to buy a domain, you actually pay for using it for a certain time and most commonly for a year or two. This means that you do have to make a new payment once your domain is about to expire. Otherwise, it goes back to being available for everybody and you lose your precious domain.I got a letter saying my domain is about to expire. How can I extend my domain?
We do care about your domain and don't want you to lose it. For that, we send out reminder e-mails so that you can easily notice when it is time to take action.In case you have bought the domain from another service provider, then you do have to keep an eye on your domain yourself. If you are not sure who the registrar of your domain is, then you can always check it from the who.is website.

After subscribing to Voog, you can move your web address (e.g. mycompany.com, mycompany.co.uk) to Voog to display your website.

Update your domain's A-record to Voog's server IP address: 85.222.234.14. Exclude the www-prefix when adding the domain name (e.g., example.com).
Create a new CNAME record for your www-domain: set the type to CNAME, the value to example.com, and the name to www.example.com.
This process will help you successfully move your domain and use the custom domain for your website.Your CNAME and A-record should now look something like this:NAMETYPEVALUEexample.comA85.222.234.14www.example.comCNAMEexample.com
Note: Changing your A-record may take up to 48 hours to propagate across the internet, depending on your domain's TTL (time to live) settings.Modify DNS Settings for Popular Registrars

Log in to GoDaddy or WildWestDomains.
In the main menu, click Domains and then My Domain Names.
Click on the address you wish to edit.
Click on the link Total DNS Control and MX Records.

For the first A-record, set the host to @ and the IP address to 85.222.234.14.
For the second A-record, set the host to www and the IP address to 85.222.234.14.

How do I change my site's design?
Click Settings > Design on the toolbar at the bottom of your site. When the design editor opens, click Browse themes. From there you can browse Voog design themes.
When you find the one you like, click on it to apply to your site. In case you have previously customized your template, you can easily reaccess our standard design view by first clicking on the "Want to switch back to a standard theme? Browse our designs" link at the bottom of the design editors front page.
If I change the design theme, will all my data be saved and imported to the new design?Yes. However, because some themes have fewer content areas or content areas are placed differently than on other designs, it is possible that some of your content will not be displayed with the new design you have chosen. Still, your data is not lost. If you switch back to the original design, all your initial content will be restored.

You can find the background picker in the upper-left corner of your default background image. By the way, depending on the template, the position of the background picker may vary.
As you click on the icon, the picker will open up which you then can manage. For example, you can replace the default image or just delete it. Instead of an image, use a preferred color from the palette.
If you open Use a custom color, you can set the opacity of the background color and insert color codes.To add a personal image as a background, upload it to the Files menu and then drag it onto the background picker.
In case your image is too busy and texts on your site become unreadable, shade the image with the color palette.
Your texts will change color automatically depending on the color of the shade - in the light background, texts become dark and on the dark background, they become light.
To remove the background color, open the color palette and click on the crossed-out icon (the transparent color), which is in the top-right corner.

This means that all of our design templates look good on screens of different sizes and are made responsive by default.Therefore you don't have to create several designs for multiple screens, and you can focus on creating the content on your website.
Still, keep in mind that if you decide to alter the design with the design editor, we do not guarantee that your design will be perfect on every screen and you do have to test it on your own.
