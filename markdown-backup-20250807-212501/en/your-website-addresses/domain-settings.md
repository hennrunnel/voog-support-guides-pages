Where can I manage the domain settings?Go to Settings > Domains view and click on the three dots icon at the end of the domain line and select Settings. You can configure both technical and personal domainDefault domain formIf you have ever researched how to improve your website's SEO, then you might be aware that it's not the best solution to share your links both with and without the www-part. If you confirm one default form for your domain, you can rest assured that it's always delivered in one form.
RedirectingYou can use the redirecting feature, for example, when you have registered multiple domains with your website and now wish to direct them all to one particular address.Make sure that before you redirect your domain address to another one, the new address surely works and displays your web page.
Acquiring SSL certificateYou can add a free Let's Encrypt certificate from the Settings > Domains > SSL certificates view. Select the domain or domains you want the certificate for and activate the process. The certificate addition usually takes effect within a few hours to 24 hours.You can get an option to add your own certificate by another service provider by subscribing to our Premium plan.

Go to your domains menu and click on the toggle button of Force SSL to activate it.Make sure the SSL certificate is activated before you force SSL.  You can check that by typing your website's address on the URL bar with https:// prefix and when it displays your site, you're good to go. Otherwise, you lose access to your website.
