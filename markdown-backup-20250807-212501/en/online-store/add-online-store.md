All Voog subscriptions (including the 30-day Trial) support e-commerce on your site, so - building an online store has never been easier. To get started, add your store's general information and products, set up shipping and payment methods, and customize checkout fields if necessary.  Follow the steps below to configure the necessary settings and launch your store. You’ll find all the required information by clicking Store > Settings on the toolbar at the bottom of the screen.
Setting up general store informationYou’ll find your store’s general information under Store > Settings > Store information. Make sure to complete all fields marked with an asterisk (*) for your store to be visible to website visitors. From the Store information view, you can: enter or edit your store details and addressconfigure invoice detailsadd, edit, or remove VAT ratesmanage your store visibility by choosing whether it’s fully active with sales enabled, visible only for showcasing products, or the store is completely inaccessible to the public. Adding shipping methodsTo add shipping methods, go to Store > Settings > Shipping methods. Here you can add suitable options — either automatically updated pick-up points lists (Omniva, DPD, SmartPosti) or custom shipping methods (e.g., courier, pick up your parcel yourself). You can find more details in the shipping guide. Shipping labels and automatic data exchange You can enable automatic data exchange for downloading shipping labels directly from your Voog order view. This applies to Omniva, DPD, and SmartPosti services. Setting up payment methodsBy default, invoice payment is enabled. You can also add the following payment methods:Voog PaySwedbank e-commerce paymentsMaksekeskus payment optionsMontonioPayPalEveryPay  These can be configured under Store > Settings > Payments. Learn more in the payment methods guide. Adding productsWhen you add a new product to your store, a product page is automatically generated in all site languages. You can access (and view) these automatically generated product pages in two ways:through product list view.Via a direct link, which you can find in the Edit product view, under the Locations section. There, the address of the product page is displayed — by clicking the arrow icon next to it, the product page will open in a new view.
You can add products in three ways: Product management view — add and manage products via the Products view. Learn more about using the product management view.Products content area — add products directly in the page content where they will be displayed. Learn how to add products using the Products content area. Importing products from a file — if you're dealing with a larger quantity of products, importing them from a file is a convenient and efficient way to add them all at once. This method allows you to save time by uploading multiple products in bulk, rather than adding each one manually. Learn more in the product import guide. Important information when adding products:Product variants — variations allow you to add different options to the same product, such as sizes, colors, etc. Read how to add product variants.Stock value — helps track inventory and prevent stockouts. More info in the stock management guide.Product categories — products can be placed in different categories (e.g. clothes, shoes, handbags, etc.) to make the store clearer and easier to navigate for customers. Learn to assign product categories. Customer notificationsAs the store owner, you will receive a notification of every new order. Your store system sends automated email notifications to the customer in the following cases: When the customer selects invoice payment  — an order confirmation with a PDF invoice is sent to the customer.When the order has been successfully paid (including via bank link or other online payment methods) — a payment confirmation is sent to the customer. Read more about email notifications. Customizing checkout fieldsGo to Store > Settings > Checkout to add, remove, or modify checkout form fields.Learn more about customizing checkout fields. Terms and refund policyTo ensure a trustworthy and transparent shopping experience, your cart should include a link to your store’s terms and refund policy page. This allows customers to review important information before completing their purchase. If you don’t have your own terms yet, you can use Voog sample templates as a starting point. You’ll find them in your store under Store > Settings > Store information, next to the Communication section. To set this up:Create a new hidden page on your sitePaste and customize the sample termsHide the page from the menuCopy the page URL and add it to Store > Settings > Store information next to the Communication section  See the guide how to create a terms of service page link. Test order and order managementBefore going live, make a test order to ensure everything (emails, payments, notifications) works properly. After a test order, we recommend: Mark the order as canceled — this is useful when you want to cancel the order yourself for any reason. Cancelling an order will release the product reservation, making the item available for purchase again.Archive the order — helps keep your order list clean and organized. See the guide on managing orders. Please note that all transactions with the payment status Paid are included in the e-commerce transaction fee calculation. If you cancel an order, no transaction fee will be charged for that transaction. Read more about how e-commerce transaction fee is calculated.ReportsSales reports are valuable for every shop owner.
