It's possible to reorganise the content areas to a different order on your Voog page. To move a content area, simply hover over it with your cursor in the edit mode and grab it from the drag button that appears at the top of the content area.
Then, drag it to the approximate preferred location. A blue line will assist you, pointing out all of the available nearby locations for this particular content area.
To place it, release the dragged area and it will be dropped into the slot where the blue line indicated. Please note that the content area text style might change when it's moved from one area to another. That happens because of the different style attributes of a certain content area but it's always possible to change it with the text toolbar.
