## Purpose
Switch a page to a different layout (front page, common page, blog & news, product, product list).

## Steps
1) Open the page that needs a layout change.
2) Click the page settings icon.
3) Choose a new layout and click Save.

## Result
The page uses the new layout.

Note: Some designs may hide parts of the content when switching layouts. Content isnâ€™t deleted; switching back restores visibility.
