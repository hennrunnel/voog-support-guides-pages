## Purpose
Configure your Voog website’s domain options: default form (www vs non‑www), redirects, SSL, and iframe embedding.

## Prerequisites
- You can open Voog admin
- Your domain is connected to the website

## Steps
1) Open Settings > Domains.
2) Click the three dots at the end of the domain row and choose Settings.

### Set the default domain form
- Choose whether your default address includes www (example.com or www.example.com).
- This helps search engines avoid duplicate URLs.

### Add a redirect
- Use redirects when you own multiple domains and want them to point to a single address.
- Ensure the destination address loads correctly before creating the redirect.

### Acquire an SSL certificate
- Go to Settings > Domains > SSL certificates.
- Select domain(s) and start the free Let’s Encrypt certificate. Propagation may take up to 24 hours.
- Premium plan users can add a custom certificate from another provider.

### Force SSL
- Enable Force SSL in the domains menu to serve only https:// traffic.
- Confirm the certificate is active first. If not, forcing SSL can temporarily block access.

### Allow embedding in an iframe
- Enable only if you need other sites to display parts of your site via iframe.

## Result
Your preferred domain form is active, optional redirects are in place, and your site serves securely over HTTPS.
