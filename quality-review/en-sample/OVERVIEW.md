## Notable Before → After Examples

### Payment methods

Before:

> Additionally, I would like to draw your attention to the fact that before adding payment provider...

After:

> Before you add a payment provider, make sure your website uses a personal domain and includes privacy policy and terms pages.

### Page layout

Before:

> NB! Note that once you change... No need to panic, though – nothing is deleted...

After:

> Note: Some designs hide content when switching layouts. Your content isn’t deleted; switching back restores visibility.

## How these were improved

- Titles normalized to imperative voice; friendly, concise tone
- Standard sections: Purpose, Prerequisites, Steps, Result/Notes, Related guides
- Consistent UI breadcrumb format: Settings > Domains
- Terminology aligned: website, payment provider, SSL
- Internal links prefer local HTML where applicable, with Original URL preserved in frontmatter
