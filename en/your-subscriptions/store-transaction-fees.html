<div class="ListingArticleContent">
<p>For both Standard and Plus plans, the transaction fee is 3% of the total sale. However, if you use <a href="/support/online-store/voog-pay" target="_blank">Voog Pay</a> for your transactions, we won't charge you any commission at all.</p><p><br/></p><p>We calculate the percentage based on the transaction amount (invoice amount including VAT). All online store transactions with a payment status of <b>Paid</b> will be considered – this means that if a customer has left an invoice unpaid or you have cancelled an order, we will not apply the transaction fee for such transactions.<br/><br/><b>Note: There is no transaction fee in the Premium plan and with <a href="/support/online-store/voog-pay" target="_blank">Voog Pay</a> payments.<br/></b><br/>You can pay the transaction fee based on the invoice we issue when the unpaid transaction fee accumulated by the end of the previous month is at least €30. The invoice will include VAT on top of the transaction fee. Here's a detailed example of the calculation:<br/><br/>If a purchase is made in your online store for €50, Voog calculates the transaction fee as follows:<br/><i> 0.03 * €50 = €1.5</i>.</p><p><br/>In addition, the applicable VAT (20%) is calculated on the transaction fee:</p><p><i>0.2 * €1.5 = €0.3</i>.</p><br/><p>So, the final transaction fee for this sale is</p><p><i>€1.5 + €0.3 = €1.8</i>.<br/><br/>To view a summary of your store's sales and accumulated transaction fees, you can access the online store reports. To do this, open the menu and go to <b>Store &gt; Reports</b>, where you'll see a monthly summary of sales and transaction fees. For a more detailed overview, simply click on a specific row.</p>
