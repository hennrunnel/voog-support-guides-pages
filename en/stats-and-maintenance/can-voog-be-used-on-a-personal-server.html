However, this means that you are not able to edit your website like in Voog and it will stay static. <br/><br/>However, we do have made some exceptions by creating a separate instance on other servers. If you are a big national enterprise and would like to see your corporation running on Voog on your very own server, then write to us at <a href="mailto:sales@voog.com" target="_blank">sales@voog.com</a>.</p><h2 class="is_anchor" data-anchor="true" id="is-there-an-option-for-whitelabel">Is there an option for white-label?</h2><p>Indeed, there is. Several hosting companies are using Voog as their website builder service and we are more than happy to discuss further options. <a href="mailto:sales@voog.com" target="_blank">Contact our sales team</a> for more information.</p><a href="http://www.edicy.com/support/server" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"></a>
