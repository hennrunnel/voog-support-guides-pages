To facilitate the automatic detection of column types, we recommend using the same field names as described in the supported import fields section.<br/><br/> <ul><li><b>Import of products without variations</b> - each product is on a separate line. Minimum columns are “Name” and “Price” upon creation, and “ID”, “Name” and “Price” for updating.</li><li><b>Import of products with variations</b> - there are 2-N rows for each product. The first row, or the main product row (matrix), contains the basic information of the product (e.g., name, URL, categories, default price). The following rows are the product variation rows, where the value in the "Parent ID" must match the value in the "ID" column of the main product.</li></ul> <h2 class="is_anchor" data-anchor="true" id="product-import-process">Product import process</h2><ol><li>Navigate to <b>Store &gt; Products</b> view, click on the three dots at the top corner of the page, and in the menu that opens, choose <b>Import products</b>.<br/><div class="edy-texteditor-container image-container edy-positionable-container-maxwidth extra-wide-image edy-image-container-with-title" contenteditable="false" data-image-id="20573947" data-title="Import products button in products menu." style="max-width: 100%; text-align: left; display: block; float: none; width: auto; overflow: hidden; position: relative;" unselectable="on">

</div></li><li>Note that for importing products, all added information must be in the correct format and structure. If at least one product (which could be a single product, or a main product + variations) does not validate or is faulty, the entire import will be canceled. However, under certain conditions, a row will be ignored. For example, if the first row is immediately a variation row and its main product row is missing, then the variation row will be ignored, and the import will start with the first main product if it is found in the following rows.<br/><br/></li><li>On the opened <b>Import Products</b> page, you can upload the file to be imported (preferably XLSX, ODS).<br/><br/></li><li>Before importing products, please familiarize yourself with</li><ul><li><a href="https://media.voog.com/0000/0036/2183/files/voog-products-import-demo.xlsx" target="_self">sample import file</a></li><li><a href="/support/online-store/products-import#importing-product-translations" target="_self">information on importing translatable fields</a><br/><br/></li></ul><li>Choose the language in which you want to import products.<br/><br/></li><li>Set the matches between columns and product fields.<br/><br/></li><li>After uploading the import file, you will be shown all the columns found in the file, the content of their first 4 rows, and an option to decide if and how each column is imported as a field.
